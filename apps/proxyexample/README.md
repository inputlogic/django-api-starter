# Proxy Endpoint Example

## Who is this for?:

This is for applications that need to process data via third party APIs. There is the option
of manipulating data flowing to and from the third party API endpoints within our endpoint.

For example, the Goose project has an endpoint that accepts requests for insurance policy
creation. The logic in the endpoint validates the data in the request, creates an internal record
in the data base for the policy, then forwards the data to a TuGo endpoint that creates the actual
policy within the TuGo system. The TuGo endpoint then returns information such as the newly
generated policy and pricing. The Goose endpoint logic updates the internal policy with the
data returned by TuGo, and then responds with a success or error message.

The proxyexample implementation is kept simple. There is no manipulation of the data during the
processing. This example does a straight pass thru of a request to a third party endpoint, and
returns the data as is. It is merely a starting point for handling proxy API calls.
